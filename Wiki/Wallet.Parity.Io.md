The service [wallet.parity.io](https://wallet.parity.io/) has been deprecated and can not be used anymore. Instead, a page was created to allow you to download the keystore file (JSON/UTC) for users to be able to access their account with parity client or 3rd party applications. Note that to be able to access your account, you will need to open it using a password set at the account creation. Without this password, no application can access your account.

- In the hamburger menu from the top right corner, select `Try beta!`.
- Using Metamask in full-screen mode is more convenient, click on the arrow icon at the top right to switch to full screen.
